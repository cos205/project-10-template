# Project 10

The project description is provided in the file Project 10.pdf

## Materials

```/tools```

This directory includes all the simulators and tools for this project.

```/src```
This directory includes all the files required to complete this project.

```/grader```
Do not modify this repository. It is necessary for running the github grading scripts.

When you push a change to github, an autograder script will be triggered. You will see a commit from the autograding workflow. When the workflows complete (it may take a few seconds) you will see a grade assigned to the commit based on whether you passed our tests. 

The autograding workflow may have some additional output to help you debug. But, you must test locally, and not rely solely on the autograder.

## Collaboration

You may work on this assignment in teams of two, or individually.
